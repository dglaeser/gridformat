# `GridFormat` 0.2.1

## Features

- __Traits__: support for outputting writing `Dune::FieldMatrix` as tensor field data. 

# `GridFormat` 0.2.0

## Features

- __Documentation__: the available file formats are now listed as a separate Doxygen group.
- __CI__: for PRs, only the tests affected by changes in the PR are built and run in order to speed up the workflows.
- __Field__: `Field::export` now accepts r-values, which will be used to populate the values and return them again. Thus, one can now write `const auto values = field.export_to(std::vector<double>{})`, where `auto` will be `std::vector<double>`.
- __Traits__: added a `GridFactoryAdapter` for `Dune::GridFactory` to the dune traits to facilitate exporting read grids into dune grids.
