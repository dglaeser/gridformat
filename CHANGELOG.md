# `GridFormat` 0.2.1

## Features

- __Traits__: support for writing `Dune::FieldMatrix` as tensor field data.
- __CI__: on PRs, a bunch of performance benchmarks are run with the code of the PR and the target branch, and observed runtime differences are posted as a comment to the pull request.
- __Reader__: the `Reader` class now allows for opening a file upon instantiation using `GridFormat::Reader::from(filename)` (taking further optional constructor arguments). Moreover, you can now open a file and receive the modified reader as return value using `reader.with_opened(filename)`.
- __VTK__: VTK-XML files of the older file format version 0.1 can now also be read by all vtk readers

## Deprecated interfaces

- __CI__: the CI helper scripts, for instance, to select tests affected by changes, have been moved from the `/bin` to the  `/test` directory.
- __Common__:
    - the `get_md_layout<SubRange>(std::size_t)` overload is deprecated as it may interfere with `get_md_layout<Range>(Range)` if `Range` is constructible from an `std::size_t` and the template argument `Range` is explicitly specified. The intented behaviour can now be achieved with `MDLayout{{std::size_t}}.with_sub_layout_from<SubRange>()`.
    - related to the above, an `MDLayout` for a scalar value now has a dimension of zero to distinguish it from a vector of size 1.

# `GridFormat` 0.2.0

## Features

- __Documentation__: the available file formats are now listed as a separate Doxygen group.
- __CI__: for PRs, only the tests affected by changes in the PR are built and run in order to speed up the workflows.
- __Field__: `Field::export` now accepts r-values, which will be used to populate the values and return them again. Thus, one can now write `const auto values = field.export_to(std::vector<double>{})`, where `auto` will be `std::vector<double>`.
- __Traits__: added a `GridFactoryAdapter` for `Dune::GridFactory` to the dune traits to facilitate exporting read grids into dune grids.
