@defgroup API
@brief The high-level API and recommended way of using `GridFormat`
@details The high-level API exposes all available file formats and the generic
         GridFormat::Writer, which takes an instance of one of the formats and a
         grid that is to be written. For instance, to construct a writer for the .vtu
         file format for your `grid`, write
         @code{.cpp}
             GridFormat::Writer writer{GridFormat::vtu, grid};
         @endcode

         You can also let `GridFormat` select a default for you:
         @code{.cpp}
             GridFormat::Writer writer{GridFormat::default_for(grid), grid};
         @endcode

         Some file formats take configuration options. For instance, the .vtu file
         format allows you to specify (among other options) an encoder to be used:
         @code{.cpp}
             GridFormat::Writer writer{
                GridFormat::vtu({.encoder = GridFormat::Encoding::base64}),
                grid
             };
         @endcode

         For more information on these options, see GridFormat::FileFormat::VTU.
         Note that all writers take the given grid by reference, and thus, their
         validity is bound to the lifetime of the grid.
