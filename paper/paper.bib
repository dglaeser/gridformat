abstract = {DuMux is a free and open-source simulator for flow and transport processes in porous media, based on the Distributed and Unified Numerics Environment (DUNE). Its main intention is to provide a sustainable and consistent framework for the implementation and application of model concepts, constitutive relations, discretizations, and solvers. The paper provides an overview of DuMux with the focus on software-related aspects. Selected examples highlight the multi-scale and the parallel capabilities.}
