abstract = {DuMux is a free and open-source simulator for flow and transport processes in porous media, based on the Distributed and Unified Numerics Environment (DUNE). Its main intention is to provide a sustainable and consistent framework for the implementation and application of model concepts, constitutive relations, discretizations, and solvers. The paper provides an overview of DuMux with the focus on software-related aspects. Selected examples highlight the multi-scale and the parallel capabilities.}

abstract={The diverse message passing interfaces provided on parallel and distributed computing systems have caused difficulty in movement of application software from one system to another and have inhibited the commercial development of tools and libraries for these systems. The Message Passing Interface (MPI) Forum has developed a de facto interface standard which was finalised in Ql of 1994. Major parallel system vendors and software developers were involved in the definition process, and the first implementations of MPI are already appearing. This article presents an overview of the MPI initiative and the standard interface, in particular those aspects which merge demonstrated research with common practice.},
